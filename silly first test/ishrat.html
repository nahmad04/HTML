            <p> we stumbled over this piece of evidence while we were doing research about our said suspect.</p>
            <p> who knows if this said suspect knew that whatever she was doing in this picture was being documented</p>
            <p> we have reason to believe that she is loud and proud about this very sensitive topic, it's disgusting. </p>
        
            <br>

            <p>
                now, lets talk about this 
                <span style = "font-weight:900">
                    very obvious 
                </span> 
                piece of evidence we have.
            </p>

            <p> i believe that it's very self explanatory. </p>
        
            <br> 

            <p> if we look closely, </p>
            <p> she is holding a bottle, that she is drinking</p>
            <p> the bottle is labeled as "piss". </p>
            <p> the bottle contains a yellow liquid. </p>

            <p> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>

            <h2> CONCLUSION. </h2>

            <p> based on context clues that we have gathered from our evidence, we can only assume that the suspect is drinking pee. </p>
            <p> and therefore, ishrat is a pee drinker. </p>
            <p> thank you for your time. </p>
